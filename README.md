UserControl
===========

Explores ways of giving users more control of a web experience. Details in JS source files. 
The scripts should work with any HTML and CSS template, provided ID and class names are consistent.
Some example ones are given just to try out (e.g. HotKeyTest2.js goes with HotKeyTest2.html).
